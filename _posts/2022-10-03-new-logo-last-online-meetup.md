# New logo

Thanks to woolly from [Engineers.MY](https://engineers.my/), we now have a new
logo.

# Last online meetup

Since movement control order (MCO) started in Malaysia around 2020, we stopped
having bi-monthly meetup for Rust Malaysia. We stopped meetups for a year and
started since last year (2021). But this year we started having online meetups
for Rust Malaysia as we feel it is not safe. We started with bi-monthly meetup
on second Wednesday of every two months.

This gave us the opportunity invite speakers from non-KL parts like
Thien Pow from Penang, he gave a talk on frontend regarding rust-
dominator before MCO (that talk was not recorded), since it is online
now he have the opportunity to easily give [the talk][thienpow] online (the
recording is a bit blur), he talked about syscamore this time.

Besides, we have some new faces and speakers, like Hanif Bin Ariffin (hbina)
sharing [his experience using axum framework][hbina] from work. Shawn Tan
(sybreon) giving a talk about [Rust from a C++ developer's perspective][sybreon].

As for the next year, there are plans to start going back to physical meetup
for Rust Malaysia so we can meet each other again. Hopefully for the next
meetup we can make use of this chance and try to grab some speakers that are
not in Malaysia.

Stay rusty and rewrite it in rust (RiiR). \o/
